The pain is made worse with overuse of the shoulder beyond normal, everyday activities (running, heavy lifting, pushups). I have adapted my lifestyle to exclude activities that cause pain.  This continued for 7 years until I became pregnant and the pain disappeared entirely for the duration of my pregnancy and 2 yrs following my son's birth. At 2.5 years post birth, I experienced extreme pain in my left hip joint. This pain first presented itself on a 12 hour car ride. I stepped out of the car after 8 hrs of driving and collapsed from pain - unable to bear any weight on my left leg.  The pain would appear every morning making walking almost impossible for the first 2 -3 hrs after waking. The pain would gradually get better throughout the day but never completely go away. Riding in a car always made the pain significantly worse. Sitting caused stiffness, but did not worsen or lessen the pain. Walking relieved both pain and stiffness.  I began taking 800mg of Advil 4 times per day. I took my first 800 mg dose at 7am and experienced pain relief within 30-40min, allowing me to walk normally. I took another 800mg dose at 11am and another at 3pm and another at 7pm.",

Was dizzy and tired all the time could barely think. During the early part of these symptoms I blacked out at the top of the stairs and fell to the bottom. Couldn't remember who I was or where I was for about an hour before memory slowly came back. I had no injuries at all from the fall. I always felt nauseous. After a few months I noticed my neck getting a bump in the front, my weight started to climb with no change to diet in fact I was eating less because too tired to eat. My nails were brittle, my hair was dry and brittle. My heart rate often would start racing very fast at around 190+beats per minute. I slept for 12 hours and woke up exhausted still. Symptoms got better for a while but I was still unwell. Just before I got pregnant with my first child I had very bad headache that there was hardly any relief for for six months. I was still dizzy and feeling sick almost constantly. GP's at the time ignored my pleas. Even prescribing anti depressants without any tests at all. I refused to take them. (I fell pregnant and quit my very stressful job as I felt I would lose the baby of I didn't do so. Doc's suspect the same. The headaches disappeared as suddenly as they'd started. \nAt 20 weeks pregnant I started to swell a lot, I had lower back pain which I'd experienced a lot of over the years. I felt I needed the loo all the time but couldn't go. My joints began to swell and burn with pain. I had to be helped into and out of the bath. My skin on my legs and waist start to dent with pressure and remain dented for some time. I went into hospital at 24 weeks. I was monitored very carefully by many Doctors. The joint pain eased after being in hospital but I was very swollen with water retention. The Doc's were worried about kidney failure. I was put on blood thinners, given two steroid injections for the baby, put on steroid tablets, I had to have an iron infusion as I was very anaemic. But my iron levels were fine and Doc's realised my red blood cells were very low. So I had to have blood transfusions. I had four pints of blood altogether. My blood count went from six to 12. I was on medication for too high potassium for a week. At 31 weeks my eye sight in my right eye got really fuzzy. I was checked for a blood clot, and was diagnosed with having so much fluid on me that it was putting pressure on my cornea. ",
